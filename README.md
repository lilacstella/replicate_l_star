## Setup
I am currently experimenting with using the `automathon` library for visualizing the DFAs that we are generating. 

In the python environment for this project
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To use the `graphviz` library, we need the executable of the same name on our path. For mac, 

```bash
brew install graphviz
```
